## Introduction

MineSweeper is a classic puzzle game where you have to uncover all the non-mine locations without detonating any mines. This game involves a 2D minefield that contains hidden mines in random locations. The player has to uncover locations and guess mine locations until they uncover all the non-mine locations or detonate a mine.

This MineSweeper game has a 9x9 field with 10 hidden mines. The game interface allows the player to left-click on a button to uncover a square, and if it's a non-mine location, the number of adjacent hidden mines will be displayed. If there are no mines adjacent to that square, it will display no number. If the player uncovers a mine, it explodes, and they lose the game.

## How to Play

- Click on any square to start the game.
- Uncover all the non-mine locations on the board without detonating any mine.
- If you suspect that a square has a mine, right-click on that square to mark it as a mine-guess with a yellow square.
- If you are unsure about a square, right-click on it again to mark it with a question mark (?).
- The number of mines left to guess is displayed at the upper left of the window.
- If you successfully uncover all the non-mine locations, the field display changes to show where the other mines are, and you win the game.
- If you detonate a mine, the exploded mine is shown by a red square, and you lose the game.
